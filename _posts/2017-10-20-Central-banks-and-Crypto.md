Central banks and Crypto currencies

The Russian Central Bank recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-17/authoritarian-cryptocurrencies-are-coming<"> announced plans for its own cryptocurrency</a>. The point of Bitcoin is, it has no central control. A central bank issued crypto currency will be, well “centralized”!

Why would they do it? Because it allows policy to be transmitted far more efficiently. The central bank can create and destroy currency immediately. If they want to stimulate the economy they can credit money directly to consumers, instantaneously. They can control fees paid for transfers, it’s a simple protocol and therefore programming change. Kryptonite for banks was and is not Bitcoin: It’s a central bank issued currency.

Think about it, if you have a central bank issued currency like the crypto-Ruble. Who needs a bank account when you have an account at the central bank?

It’s a bit like the referee joining the match! It’s clear to me that the banks, by allowing themselves to be forced to invade peoples’ privacy with AML/KYC have become gatekeepers to the economy. The next step is obvious, central bank crypto-currencies, and at that point banks are no longer relevant except as loan providers.

Of course every country will be different. The US will “privatise” with companies like Ripple. China and Russia will go with state control.

What does this mean for individual freedom? It’s catastrophic. Every transaction will be logged and recorded forever; your wealth will never be secure; any future government will be able to defraud you based on the history of the transactions you made or your ancestors made. In addition the central power will have the ability to inflate or deflate the currency at will.

It’s just common sense that no-one or no group has the ability or knowledge for such power. The answer is the same as it has always been: Societies will organize themselves, some will choose the responsible path of decentralization and people power. Others, the centralized path of concentrated power, which has always led to destruction.

Never a dull day in crypto land, be careful out there these are dangerous times.
