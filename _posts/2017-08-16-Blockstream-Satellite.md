Blockstream satellite

I saw this <a href="https://blockstream.com/satellite/">announcement</a> yesterday… Wow, just wow! Consider the implications, it strengthens the Bitcoin network. Sure you still need a way to upload transactions. Sure you can argue that the base station can be compromised, sure the satellite company can be forced to stop the transmission.

Consider though, you can now see the blockchain from almost anywhere, even if you have no internet connection or only a patchy one; or one where data is extremely expensive. Try to run a full Bitcoin core node and download the entire blockchain on an expensive data line. You won’t, I promise!! But a satellite dish and LNB are not that hard to come by. Plus, even in far flung corners of the world that have despotic regimes, the roofs look like a forest of satellite dishes. It’s hard to say whether they are syncing the blockchain or downloading government propaganda.

The freedom this gives people all over the world to transact is astonishing. Humans are ingenious and will grasp any opportunity. This will allow a farmer stuck in a rural area with no bank account to transact with anyone anywhere across the planet.

So caveats aside, this is a major step forward in the evolution of the Bitcoin network.

Also consider the acrimony surrounding the Bitcoin cash fork. Given that Blockstream has committed real funds to this: Real skin in the game as opposed to the opposing side, whose motivations never seemed clear.
