Uncapped ICO sales

If, like me you are starting to get irritated with all the ads during your web browsing, then try <a href="https://brave.com/">BRAVE</a>. Right it’s a bit clunky, but boy is it fast! Not having to download all the annoying crud, makes BRAVE a lot lot faster.

Ok so how does anybody make money putting content on the Internet, if there are no ads? Don't get me wrong I don't mind ads I just don't like it when they are invasive and irrelevant or impose on my privacy. It’s a natural human/animal trait “hey I am anonymous so who cares, I am gonna do what ever I want!” Fine, but not with with my attention time. I deliberately keep my posts short and simple. It’s really not hard to make them incomprehensible, so that I can sit back and say “look how clever I am and how dumb everyone else is”. Truth is people are not dumb, they just don’t have infinite time to traul through tons of garbage.

So what has this got to do with ICOS and tokens? Well, on 31 May 2017 BRAVE issued a token called the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/token/"> BasicAttentionToken or BAT</a>. The sale went live on 31 May 2107, and it was over in two Ethereum blocks: Given the average Ethereum block time is 14s, they raised $35m in 30 seconds. Read that again, 30s or half a minute. Of course the twittersphere erupted into howls of anger.

I just want to make a few points:

Glad they got the money it’s a good project, I hope it succeeds.
The issue with these ICOs is that they are capped; rather make them uncapped.
Only a few addresses, I think I read 130, actually got any tokens.
This is what I think happened, a number of people joined together and pooled their money, and then put a huge bid at the start, to make sure that they succeeded. They paid a massive fee, I believe 2 000 Ether (I have not checked). By putting a huge fee, miners would prioritise it and so they would jump to the head of the queue. The order was big so the fee is still small as a percentage. The sale was capped so basically they satisfied the sale. Once done, they can distribute the tokens amongst the participants or just sell the tokens at a profit and distribute the profits.

In my last post: I said be careful out there. This was not a particular clever scheme, but it’s surprising it took this long to occur.

A clear way to prevent it is to have uncapped sales that last for a fixed period of time.
