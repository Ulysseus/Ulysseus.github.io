ASICBOOST

Never a dull day in cryptoland! Woke up to the news of ASICBOOST. If you are reading this I assume you know what I am talking about.

Firstly my position on this, Miners who have been using this, are not cheating, they found an optimization to the mining algorithm, good luck to them.

Okay so lets see what we know: ASICBOOST works and gives a major advantage to a miner. It seems that only some miners have access to the technology at the moment. SEGWIT will break the ASICBOOST optimization. Clearly its in the interests of these miners to block SEGWIT.

How to trade this, in my opinion if SEGWIT passes, BTC jumps to $1500. If we go the contentious hard fork route BTC drops to $750 plus whatever BTU is worth.

Clearly this news is bullish for BTC, why because miners that don’t have access to ASICBOOST will signal for SEGWIT. To my mind the successor to BTC is Zcash, but the market does not see it that way, the trade seems to be LTC. So if BTC hard forks LTC will jump, the trade will be to sell BTC for LTC.

If BTC adopts SEGWIT: Long BTC short LTC. Or just stay long BTC.

“That which does not kill me makes me stronger”, prepare for a volatile ride. If you are long BTC, hold. It’s going to be interesting to see what the miners response is to all this is. They may start selling BTC miners that contain ASICBOOST, but I believe the stratum pool protocol does not support the algorithm.

As I said at the beginning, I don’t believe exploiting ASICBOOST is cheating. Having said that, it’s clearly not good for BTC as it creates centralization, although the rational thing for someone exploiting ASICBOOST to do, is to keep it secret and not to take over mining completely. It’s as if you find a way to counterfeit BTC, better not to flood the market and destroy BTC.
