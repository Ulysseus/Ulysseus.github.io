SAFT Project

I started off my adult life planning to become an academic. My university career started with engineering, but I quickly changed to a pure science track, ending in chemistry, mainly because the chemistry department at my university was much more dynamic than the physics department. It was the early days of the computer revolution in the 1980s.

My PhD thesis was entitled “Potential energy functions and algorithms in chemistry”. Basically it’s theoretical chemistry; until recently, I had trouble explaining what theoretical chemistry is, it’s the application of computers/algorithms to chemical problems.

Of course once I graduated, I quickly discovered that unless I worked as an academic I was largely unemployable. Only one industry was interested in my skills: the banking sector. Why? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barings_Bank"> Nick Leeson’s blow up of Barings Bank</a> occurred and suddenly risk management mattered, and people with a PhD in a hard theoretical science were in demand. So I entered banking via risk management and quickly moved onto derivative trading.

The point of that little excursion into my past, was just to get to derivative trading. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from a another financial security. The kind of derivatives I was involved in were bespoke contracts traded between banks and their corporate customers. The industry quickly settled on a standard “contract” generically called an ISDA.

Basically you would sign an <a href="http://www2.isda.org/about-isda">ISDA</a> with other banks and your clients. When you executed a trade you would specify which clauses did not apply to that particular trade. The interesting thing was this was a peer to peer market place, there was no centralized exchange or clearing house. Centralized exchanges and clearing houses do exist, but the derivatives traded on them were standardized and not bespoke. Generally we used the exchanges and standardized contracts to hedge the bespoke ones we developed for our clients.

And onto the point the <a href="https://saftproject.com/"> SAFT</a> framework, “The SAFT Project is a forum for the discussion of a compliant framework for token sales. The goal: To develop an industry standard that protects the interests of network creators, investors, and users.”

The issue with ICO’s is simply this: Are they securities or are they utility tokens? In either case they potentially run foul of jurisdictions laws governing securities and/or consumer protection. Clearly one of the most useful things about ICOs is their global nature. In an ISDA contract you could choose the legal jurisdiction, I always chose “London” or English common law. Clearly in an ICO there will be multiple jurisdictions. The SAFT white paper attempts to include multiple jurisdictions.

I like this project, the <a href="https://saftproject.com/static/SAFT-Project-Whitepaper.pdf">white paper</a> is well worth the read.

Rather than try and ignore the law, if ICOs are to prove useful, it is far better to try and develop a framework similar to ISDA, that attempts to comply with the law. Instead of trying to develop bespoke solutions to every ICO project.
