# Royal Mint Gold (RMG)

This is a weird one for me. This token RMG is not a ERC20 token, it’s definitely not decentralized. So why even discuss it?

When I was a child my uncle who is also my God Father gave me a gold sovereign. Must be the scrooge in me, but I loved that coin and I still have it: its weight, its colour somehow have a mesmerizing effect on the human psyche. There’s something about the permanence of gold that appeals to us. It does not corrode, its rare in the entire universe and its dense. If you grew up as I did with a sense of the impermanence of human societies it was not lost on you that gold will always be a hedge against the collapse of civilization. I have a book of Greek paper currency notes issued over the war period from 1940–1945 and the largest bill denomination shown in the image below is 10 000 000 000 drachmas. Basically the currency was worthless. Growing up with those realities probably had an effect on me. I remember when the US broke the peg to gold. I was very young but I remember my uncle buying gold at $33 an ounce. When I was about 12, I took my life savings and bought a Krugerrand coin (1 ounce of 22 carat gold) for about $112. I sold it for about $880 some four years later. Since then I have had a love affair with gold. I invested heavily in gold just before the 1987 crash, on the day of the crash it shot up in value and then fell sharply: I did my boots on the trade. I learnt two things, firstly protect trading capital at all costs, and secondly that predicting markets is for the birds.

Drachma notes from WW2 Look at the Number pinted on the right to see the denomination.

In the cryptocurrency market at present we are spoilt for choice. Most ICOs and tokens are going to be or are worthless. I wrote an article about Tezos (May 2017), I liked and still like the project, but given the impasse at the moment between the foundation and the originators it looks lost. Fortunately I see Token investment as a donation in the hope that maybe the eco system grows and results in something of value. At the moment it looks like my Tezzies are worth zero. I will of course hold onto the private keys, you never know it might be a forced HODL.

The Royal Mint is issuing a gold backed Token. This is fascinating, if you haven’t been following the Tether story (disclaimer), don’t, as it, takes way to much time. In short it’s a Token issued by the Bitifinex group that is backed by the dollar. Basically you are trusting that they actually have the required dollars on deposit somewhere to back the issued Tokens. So it’s centralized and you have to trust them and their auditors. I have no idea if they are honest or otherwise. The point of cryptocurrencies is that they are permisssionless and trustless. Bitcoin and other digital tokens work precisely because they are digital, that is they are not a physical thing. Gold per definition is probably the most durable physical thing in existence today.

As I write this, the valuations on the US stock market are looking stretched. Other assets like housing also seem to be stretched. A lot of early adopters of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto asssets are sitting on large gains. In many cases I imagine the gains have unbalanced their portfolios. By this I mean the following: Imagine you start with $100 and invest $5 into Ether at 30c. The rest you invest equally bonds and stocks. Realistically this what has occurred: You made say 5% on the bonds for approximately 3 years, so (1.05)³ = 1.16. The stocks have increased in value by say 100% so have doubled in value. The Ether has gone from 30c to $1200 a 390 000% return. So in monetary terms your $47.5 in bonds is now worth $55.0. Your stock investment is now worth $95 your Ether investment is now worth $20 000. Total portfolio is $20150.1 or over 99% Ether!!!

Basically your investment portfolio is now made up almost entirely of Ether. You think you better diversify? Ok but into what? Bonds are yielding negative rates?? Stocks are at all time highs and all time high valuations. Real estate?

Gold has been depressed for years, it may not be on the edge of a bull run, but presumably it will hold its value. Now as a crypto-enthusiast you would prefer decentralized. Well unless its a digital asset in the ether (yes I know silly pun) you are not gonna find it. But if you are going to invest in a physical asset, backed by a counter-party may as well go for the Royal Mint. It’s an [independent company](https://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/), owned by the HM Treasury. I was truly gob smacked when I saw the presentation on the Royal Mint Gold (RMG) token. The presenter knew his stuff, it was tight, he understood blockchain technology. But what swung it for me was when I asked: “so can I take physical delivery of the gold?” and the answer came back: “Yes you can.”

Ok so on my score card:

Originality: Backing a token with gold is an old idea. Backing a token with gold via a 1 000 year old institution who runs a secure vault is priceless.

Team: The Royal Mint very impressive from talking to them. CME Group needs no introduction as one of the biggest futures exchanges in the world. BitGo, other than the Bitfinex hack, which seems to have been a Bitfinex issue, seems solid.

Platform: It’s a permissioned chain, which of course is a bit pointless but given that it’s a physical asset; maybe it’s a necessity. I assume the Royal Mint and the CME are not in a hurry to throw away their names on a scam so I am willing to let this go. The software is called [PROVA](https://www.provachain.com/) provided by BitGo and is open source. I have not done a deep dive into BitGo and PROVA.

Valuation: Simple, it’s the gold price. Be aware that the Royal Mint plans to make its fees from the mark up that coins carry over the London fix. For smaller coins like sovereigns that can be as high as 7%. Of course for gold bars it’s significantly lower. If you buy gold and store it in a secure vault it costs fees which also have VAT charged on them. If you store it at home, you run the risk of theft. The RMG token will represent a share of allocated gold in the Royal Mint vault. It’s physically claimable. If it’s held via the Token no storage fees are charged.

Legal: Heck it’s the Royal Mint.

Fraud: No

Liquidity: They are planning on getting the Token listed on Exchanges.

I think this is a great idea, it’s a great way for people who are cryptorich to diversify their assets.
