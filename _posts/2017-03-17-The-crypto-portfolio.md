The crypto portfolio

On 23 Oct 2016 I published my founding statement, in that mentioned that I had a way of trading between risky assets. This blog was a way to record my success over time. Series seems a nice way to collect the data into one place.

So on the 23 Oct 2016 I had only two assets BTC and Ether the ratio was 40% to 60%. That is, if you invested $100 into the portfolio 60% would go into Ether and 40% into BTC at the prices prevailing on the 16 Oct 2016

On the 4 Dec 2016 I reported that I was planning to include zcash into the portfolio at that time I reported the ratio as 56% to 44% Ether to BTC

On the 6 Feb 2017 in the Melonport article I reported the ratio as 57% to 43% Ether to BTC

On Friday 17 March 2017 with the huge surge in the price of Ether you would expect a change, you would be right the ratio is 69% Ether 31% BTC, I will add some zcash this weekend. I have mined some zcash using old depreciated equipment but for the purposes of valuation I will record it as bought at cost when I do the calculation. Needless to say this is working out very very well.

So after much thought as how to add ZCash to the portfolio, I came up with a way that does not seem to be too bad. The results are as follows 61% Ether 26% BTC and 13% ZEC. Before the calculation the ratios had shifted heavily in Ethers favour at 79% Ether 21% BTC.

Its been a real struggle moving from BTC into ZEC. Because BTC transactions take so long to confirm. I am not a fan of centralized exchanges. So I am suffering, its taken nearly two days and its not yet done.

Ratios as of 27 April 2017 are 62% Ether 25% BTC 12.8% ZEC

Ratios as of 23 May 2017 are 64% Ether 22% BTC 14% ZEC. After the huge run up in ZEC you can see the Algo is chasing to keep up. That is ZEC allocation has gone up. Portfolio is doing extremely well. But in a Bull market everyone is a genius.

Ratios as of Monday 12 June 2017 are 68.6% Ether 19% BTC 12.4% ZEC. There has been a massive run up in Ether. And you can see the Algorithm is allocating more and more capital to Ether. Interestingly this means that I need to sell Ether and buy Bitcoin and ZEC. Because Ether price has gone up so much, the algorithm determines the amount of capital to allocate to an asset, the actual amount of that asset is determined by the particular price of that asset at that time. So counterintuitively a rising asset price may mean selling the asset, even though its capital allocation is higher.

Ratios as of Monday 17 Jul 2017 are 65.7% Ether 21.6% BTC and 12.7% ZEC. This of course is after the huge slump in Ether and ZEC BTC also has been hit but not quite as much as Ether and ZEC. I have a small position in Tezos difficult to include because its not actively trading yet. But the algorithm has shifted from Ether into BTC and ZEC. A worry I have is that the correllation is high between all of these currencies. The issue at the moment seems to be the impending fork in Bitcoin on the 1 August 2017. Not sure why that should affect Ether so badly.

Also over the summer the number of ICO scams has exploded. Most of these things raise Ether or Bitcoin or both, they then dump what they raise too lock in the fiat price. Hence the pressure on Ether and Bitcoin. Its really shocking to see how fast and baltant these things are!

Ratios as of Thursday 31 August 2017 are 66% Ether 22% BTC and 12% ZEC. So not much change I am surpised as to how little trading I actually do, I generally just leave it and dont rebalance unless it gets seriously out of wack with the recommended ratios. This definitely not optimal. The issue is all coins are strongly correlated. So the fork came and went my BCH is worth a fair whack, I plan to sell it all buy myslf a nice car a new iPad and some other toys. I think of it as dividend on BTC. technically it should be added back to the BTC price and used in the calculations, I am not doing that, no particular reason, other than I feel like treating myself. I have a small position in Tezos, but wont include in the portfolio until it has a trading record. The portfolio is at its high water mark!

Been a long hiatus, which I apologize for!

Ratio’s as at the 2 January 2018 are

64% Ether 24% BTC and 12% ZCash.

So Tezos has turned into a disaster. The portfolio hit a new ATH late 2017 its about 8% below that now. I have sold all of the BCH I initially sold it for BTC by the time I liquidated the BTC it had doubled. I sold too soon on the BCH.

Here is too another incredible year!

HUUUUGE crash in the markets down 60% odd from ATHs. The portfolio is down 45%. Fared better because of overweight position in Ether. Lots and Lots of Tawking down the crypto markets. Nouriel Roubini, Stiglitz, Krugman, Credit card companies. Lots of rumours of a global crackdown. In my opinion the only place to watch is Japan! Its legal in Japan unless Japan is on board rest is noise.

Ratios as at Feb 5 2018

67% Ether 21% BTC 12% ZEC.

ZEC has performed terribly. Very difficult to trade into and out of ZEC. I may dump ZEC position in its entirety, but I still like the tech?

Ratios as at 9 March 2018.

From Ether out performing its taking a brutal beating. Portfolio down 52% maybe more depending on were you mark ATH. Still lots of FUD. Still fears of a crack down.

Ratios

65.8% Ether 22.9% BTC 11.2% ZEC.

Still have issue with ZEC which means that when I have to rebalance into ZEC I just don’t. I may have missed the boat on climbing out of ZEC, starting to feel Monero may be a good replacement. Good news on Tezos front its still alive.

Decision on forks, claim the coins but don’t trade out of them.

Ratios as of 9 April 2018

Fears have abated, reason for the lack of a bid seems to be tax selling to pay for the huge tax bill that has been accrued because of the massive run in 2017. I think this makes a ton of sense. Japans tax season ended on March 15. Americas is April 15. If there is merit to the hypothesis, things should improve after April 15.

Ratios

64.2% Ether 24.6% BTC 11.2% ZEC.

Still uncomfortable with ZEC, but keeping it. Still not rebalancing into it. Selling Ether and buying BTC over the last month this was very profitable.

Ratios as of 25 June 2018

Sooo things have suddenly taken a big step down. Lots of people saying they should have taken profits in December. Two things on this, firstly Exchanges where not allowing large withdrawals, >500K. Secondly it really felt stupid selling crypto and withdrawing it into the banking system, and I mean really stupid, everytime I access my bank account, my heart is in my throat as too what information they will want now! I have decided to keep ZEC exposure but not to use it for rebalancing. Algo always has Sell BTC and Ether and Buy ZEC. Portfolio has lost 60% since the ATH.

Ratios 74.5% Ether 25.5% BTC.

Ratios as of 14 August 2018

Did not realize that I had not updated this since July. Massive leg down today.

Ratios 70.6% Ether 29.4% BTC.

Interestingly enogh at present prices this means selling BTC to buy Ether.

Portfolio down approx 75% since ATH. This is absolutely brutal. For the first time I am getting fearful. Others must literally be screaming in fear. This is a massive extinction event in the market.

Painful as it is its weakness leaving the market.

Ratios as of the 17 September 2018

Last week was brutal in the Ethereum market, really looked like an attack on Ethereum. BitMex started a new perpetual swap in Ether about 6 weeks ago so its Ether/USD but settled in BTC. really looked like a concentrated attack with all the Negative FUD thrown in as well on Ethereum. but cest la vie, Ethereum needs to survive. Ether hit a low of about $160 some recovery but not enough.

Ratios 68.3% Ether 31.7% BTC. Still selling BTC to buy Ether to rebalance.

Last week felt like hell really felt like it was all going to zero. Bit sceptical of BTC price action. Needs to move up sharply or I fear a huge decline. Down 79% from ATH.

Ratios as of 3 December 2018

Wow November was terrible, Ether at $113 Bitcoin at $4023. Much much negativity, in the market. Considering adding Cash as an asset to trade. Portfolio is down 88% from ATH. Previous Sell BTC to Buy Ether still holds very few updates as the two assets so strongly correlated. Devcon4 was in Prague I attended, really scary, the pace of change is huge, very few people keeping up. I think Vitalik and J Lubin and others are aimimg at total “domination” basically Ethereum 2 which will scale and have POS. I have never seen anything like this, no roadmap, no specs, really really fast, build it break it start again. Personally I dont think anyone else in this space can compete, but time will tell. Sentiment in the market is, crypto is dead!

Ratios 66.9% Ether 33.1% BTC.
