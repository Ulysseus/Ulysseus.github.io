Edgeless ICO

I have been able to concentrate on work these last few weeks - personal issues - which is a pity because I have not investigated <a href="https://edgeless.io/">Edgeless</a>.

This is being written up pretty quickly as the crowdsale of the ICO ends in less than one day. If you have <a href="https://metamask.io/">metamask</a> setup in chrome. If you don't go do it now, its an awesome litttle app that turns chrome into an Ethereum browser. Then find your way to <a href="https://beta.edgeless.io/">beta.edgless.io</a> and try out their beta version of Blackjack.

So the idea is very simple. Edgeless wants to create a decentralized casino, which is provably fair. The issues with online casinos are twofold: They can run off with your money and, how the hell do you know if the games are fair.

In a casino run on Ethereum smart contracts, it’s pretty easy to ensure they don't run off with your money. Provably fair is a bit harder. Consider that we don’t know each other and we decide that over a channel on the internet, say Skype or IRC or whatever, we are going to play a game called “guess a number”. The idea is for you to guess a number and for for me to guess another number, we agree on some formula, that uses uses both numbers to decide a winner. See a problem if you go first and I know your number? I will choose my number in such a way that I always win. Fortunately this problem is an old one in cryptography, the first solution was proposed by the creators of the RSA encryption protocol. These types of protocols are generically called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker">mental poker</a>. Edgeless uses protocols like this to run the games. I have not had time to go into the details of their implementation, but the point is it’s possible to do.

Edgless is issuing an ICO called, not surprisingly edge EDG.

So in terms of my scorecard

Originality: Online casinos are a dime a dozen but decentralized provably fair ones not so much. So does it solve a problem? Yes it does. What’s interesting here is that the EDG token gives you the right to participate in a monthly draw for 40% of the profits of the casino. The more edge tokens you have, the better your chances of winning.
Team: Its not a massive team and also not just two people, a quick search on their names did not yield any red flags. The <a href="https://beta.edgeless.io/"> blackjack app</a> looks good, so I think they can deliver.
Platform: Ethereum ECR20 token so that’s good.
Legality: It’s not a security. Only issue I can see is its a gambling app casinos like to jealously guard their turf. The tax implications of this token are fascinating. If you win a large amount, it can’t be skill; it’s a lottery. Depending on the tax laws in your jurisdiction it’s possible that it will be tax free.
Liquidity: It’s an ECR20 token and should be traded on Etherdelta or other exchanges. Whether anyone will sell any is another story.
Valuation: Now this where it gets interesting. I have not gone through the business plan in great detail but it looks solid on a quick perusal. There is clearly lots of money in gambling and they have set aside funds for marketing. The ICO started on the 28 February. As of writing, it’s got 21hrs left. The issue is 1 ETH = 1000 EDG and of course the ETH price has gone bonkers since the 28th February. Their cap is 440 000 ETH but given ETH is up about 4x I suppose they can get away with 110 000 ETH. So far they have raised 59 352 ETH. If ETH was still around $10 I would question whether they had enough money to deliver, but given ETH is at $44 they should have enough cash if they hedge the ETH raised into dollars.
Bottom line: I am writing this in a hurry to get it out before the ICO closes. I am quite impressed by the blackjack beta. This may be runner, and given all the drama in Bitcoin at the moment may be worth dumping one or two coins into EDG. But always remember caveat emptor. Always do your own research before giving anyone your hard earned Ether or Bitcoin.
