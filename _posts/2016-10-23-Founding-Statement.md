I have been trading professionally for over twenty years. I think it was George Soros who said: “if you identify a bubble jump on it”. Human nature being what it is, people tend to shy away when they identify a bubble, waiting for it to burst.

Crypto currencies, blockchain, Bitcoin, digital assets, digital autonomous organisations, alt-coins, meta-coins, tokens, crowd funding, decentralization are all popular words at the moment.

Are we in a bubble? …Not yet, but we are at the start of something big.

I won’t go into the details here, but decentralized systems are hard to implement properly. However, the world would be a much better place if decentralized systems were the norm.

I offer both of these as statements (that is, without proof). This my view which may or may not be correct.

Starting from this premise, I think the world needs decentralized systems. I also believe that the technology introduced by “Satashoshi Nakamoto” offers a way to create that world. Just like the internet boom of the late twentieth century, this will lead to a similar boom.

Simply put, while there will inevitably be scams and thefts, it will also bring ground breaking technology.

I want to benefit financially from this technology, but its unlikely that I will be able to participate on a straight technology platform. So, leveraging my background in research and trading, I plan to research the technology, and then invest in those coins, tokens or crowd fundings that have potential. I will use a proprietary algorithm to determine the asset allocation into each asset that I have implemented for other more traditional asset classes.

This blog serves as a discipline to force me to record my thoughts on each investment. I will also tweet, interesting news and when I post here.

Of course the standard disclaimers apply, I am not giving investment advice. If I hold a position I will disclose it, but the nature of these assets is such, that my positions change frequently, and I may liquidate an entire postion if I think I need to. I am not involved as an employee or advisor or consultant in any of the companies, crowdfunds or ICOs that I talk about.

At the moment I hold positions in Bitcoin and Ether. The split is 40% Bitcoin and 60% Ether. I am following the upcoming launch of ZCash very closely, which will become my third investment for the time being and until I identify other attractive assets.

The ICO (Initial Coin Offer) space is exploding. I am watching this space closely and will be investing in a few coins.
