I think it was George Soros who said: “if you identify a bubble jump on it”. Human nature being what it is, people tend to shy away when they identify a bubble, waiting for it to burst.</p><p name="3229" id="3229" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Crypto currencies, blockchain, Bitcoin, digital assets, digital autonomous organisations, alt-coins, meta-coins, tokens, crowd funding, decentralization are all popular words at the moment.</p><p name="51f5" id="51f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Are we in a bubble? …Not yet, but we are at the start of something big.</p><p name="039f" id="039f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I won’t go into the details here, but decentralized systems are hard to implement properly. However, the world would be a much better place if decentralized systems were the norm.</p><p name="60b6" id="60b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I offer both of these as statements (that is, without proof). This my view which may or may not be correct.</p><p name="9506" id="9506" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Starting from this premise, I think the world needs decentralized systems. I also believe that the technology introduced by “Satashoshi Nakamoto” offers a way to create that world. Just like the internet boom of the late twentieth century, this will lead to a similar boom.</p><p name="16a6" id="16a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Simply put, while there will inevitably be scams and thefts, it will also bring ground breaking technology.</p><p name="f0a5" id="f0a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to benefit financially from this technology, but its unlikely that I will be able to participate on a straight technology platform. So, leveraging my background in research and trading, I plan to research the technology, and then invest in those coins, tokens or crowd fundings that have potential. I will use a proprietary algorithm to determine the asset allocation into each asset that I have implemented for other more traditional asset classes.</p><p name="d6f2" id="d6f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This blog serves as a discipline to force me to record my thoughts on each investment. I will also tweet, interesting news and when I post here.</p><p name="e28d" id="e28d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course the standard disclaimers apply, I am not giving investment advice. If I hold a position I will disclose it, but the nature of these assets is such, that my positions change frequently, and I may liquidate an entire postion if I think I need to. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I am not involved as an employee or advisor or consultant in any of the companies, crowdfunds or ICOs that I talk about.</strong></p><p name="e79e" id="e79e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the moment I hold positions in Bitcoin and Ether. The split is 40% Bitcoin and 60% Ether. I am following the upcoming launch of ZCash very closely, which will become my third investment for the time being and until I identify other attractive assets.</p><p name="3719" id="3719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The ICO (Initial Coin Offer) space is exploding. I am watching this space closely and will be investing in a few coins.</p></div></div></section>
