Melonport

What if I told you… that I had a trading strategy guaranteed to outperform. Would you give me your savings to manage?

I doubt it. When I started writing these stories, one of my aims was to create a record. I stated in the first story that I was invested in BTC and ETH and was considering adding ZEC(ZCash).

Well, a quick update: Still have BTC and ETH and a tiny amount of ZEC. I have not introduced the ZEC to the portfolio, the algorithm for portfolio allocation requires data and I am waiting for a few more data points on ZEC. As we stand now, the portfolio is 57% BTC and 43% ETH. It’s done very well. But how do I prove that? I suppose I could trade the coins on an exchange like Kraken or Poloniex and then disclose the trading accounts. I won’t go into the details, but I can think of numerous ways of cheating those records. Ok, I could get them audited, if you trust auditing firms. But, in case you haven't been paying attention, remember Lehman, Enron and countless others.

So far I have covered, why I have no way of convincing anyone that I can actually create “alpha” trading a crypto currency portfolio. But from my side if I take money from people, I am opening myself up to all kinds of legal and regulatory risks. The only way to get around it is to either start up a fund; takes months of admin and costs lots of money; or team up with an asset manager that already has the infrastructure. Well, what if I told you there was a third way? Melonport.

Melonport is a new token offering that aims to develop the Melon protocol for asset management. So as a portfolio manager of crypto asset tokens, I will be able to create a portfolio on the Melon platform. The protocol will be written via Ethereum smart contracts. So basically, I create a portfolio, I specify which assets I can invest in and which exchanges the assets can be traded on as well as the rules regarding fees, the data providers used for marking the portfolio to market, and for the charging of fees.

Once I am finished, and given the POC I have seen, it will only take a few minutes. I deploy the portfolio. This will cost a fraction of an Ether to pay for the gas on the Ethereum chain. Now others can invest in my portfolio. The Melon protocol enforces the rules via the smart contract system of the Ethereum network. If no-one invests in my portfolio, that’s fine. I can invest in my own portfolio and develop a verified track record.

Ok so let’s apply my scorecard to the offering.

Original: Sort of. I think there is a need, but it’s not “wow what a neat idea”.

Team: It’s small but they seem competent and plan to grow with the proceeds of the token sale.

Platform: It uses Ethereum and they have Gavin Wood of Parity fame as an advisor. So it checks this box.

Legal: They are very clear the token MLN is to be used to pay for services on the platform. So it’s not a security.

Fraud: They are responsive on slack and twitter. You can never be sure, but if it’s fraud it’s a pretty tedious way of going about it. So ticks this box.

Liquidity: Doubtful there will be much liquidity. So if you invest, (cough cough) donate, expect to wait two years.

I won’t go into the details of the offering, look at the following <a href="https://contribution.melonport.com">Melonport contribution</a>. There seems to be a lot of hype surrounding this project, so I am guessing if there is a big discount for being an early investor it may be worth a punt.

A question I had was why not just use ether for the pricing? Basically, they are using an ICO token, MLN, to fund the development, clever! If you drill into it, you’ll find out that they see it as a two year project. Then they are done and the token holders get to run the protocol.

My last scorecard point is Valuation and as per usual it’s very difficult to value these things. If you funded a software project, you would have a timeline with deliverables and penalties. So you fund development and pay every time a checkpoint is reached and you are happy with the result. Here you are kind of paying up front, although they allow for future fund raising. But as an initial funder, you have no exclusive rights to participate. What this means is say you bought 50% of the MLN tokens in the first round, and they have a second round of financing, you don’t get to automatically participate to ensure your ownership remains at 50%.

So if you believe in the project and, like me you think you could actually use the platform, then donating makes sense. For a punt it might be worth it, it’s got Gavin Wood associated with it. If you remember the history of the DAO, he pulled out just before the token launch. At the time, he wrote a very clear warning in his blog post explaining his reasoning.

So I have a feeling that it will have a nice big pop. But from experience my feelings are no better than a random guess!
