Double, double, toil and trouble

Are crypto assets in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXQoFm8hbI4">bubble?</a> Short answer : No! If that makes you happy you can stop reading right away.

Approximately a year ago I approached a number of “old world” wealth managers with a proposal to launch a crypto asset portfolio using a proprietary algorithm. The idea was to use my own money, but use their auditing and brand to establish a track record. I don't actively trade, rather it’s case of allocating the money to those assets that I think are worth investing in: I have a medium series that discusses this. No one was interested in my proposal and now, one year on, my portfolio is up 1200%.

Their clients should now be asking them, why where they not interested. In the meantime I have moved on and will use Melonport to achieve the same goal, but this way I get to keep all the fees. Melonport benefits and I benefit… “Old world” wealth managers? Not so much!

I am meeting more and more people that understand that open systems have the potential to be way bigger and more profitable than closed systems. If your business model is: We gonna monetize the platform via advertising, give up now. Crypto currencies and platforms are the ultimate social good, allowing people to interact and transact. The more open and transparent your business the more transactions; the transactions the more valuable the platform.

So lets go back to 1999, Amazon raises $1.25 billion via a convertible note. In the documents filed with the SEC, a number of risks where disclosed. I include only one here:

We maintain substantially all of our computer and communications hardware at a single leased facility in Seattle, Washington. Our systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. We do not have backup systems or a formal disaster recovery plan and we may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses from a major interruption. Computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services and accepting and fulfilling customer orders.
The highlights are mine. Notice “We do not have backup systems or a formal disaster recovery plan” and people gave them $1.25 billion dollars…the fools, the idiots, oh it’s bubble, they cried. The market ran on till early 2000 when it dropped like a stone, taking Amazon stock along with it. Fast forward 17 years and look at Amazon today: It’s a Titan.

Crypto assets are nowhere near a bubble just because the price of Bitcoin is $2 200 or $4 000 or even $10 000. It’s a bubble when relative valuations go haywire, it’s a bubble when the Imperial Palace in Tokyo is valued at more than all the land in California. Bitcoin and crypto assets will only be in a bubble when their combined buying power is more than, for example, the entire market cap of the NYSE. At the moment the valuations are peanuts compared to possible value these assets can generate.

Okay, so simply put, current valuations are not high enough for a bubble. Don't mistake volatility for a bubble. Having said that I have traded various diffferent financial instruments from floor traded commodities to bespoke derivatives. I witnessed the change to electronic trading.

Trading in cryptos is like no trading I have ever known. Forget about rules, manipulation is rife. Is it profitable? Who knows. Get used to it, it’s going to get way worse, crypto trading is the ultimate anarchic capitalism. Anything goes. There will be schemes we haven’t even thought of yet.

Governments will try to regulate it. Good luck with that! This is trading on a person to person basis, it’s going to get rough out there, be careful!

And remember in a bull market everyone is a genius. Just Buy and HODL.

To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison"> Jim Morrison</a> Nobody gets out of here poor.
