Thoughts on Gnosis Launch

They raised the money, so it’s a success right? It can be argued that it’s not a success because they left to much on the table, that is, they could have raised more. On the other hand, perhaps it’s ok because better not to annoy “investors/donators”.

Let’s back track: This is not an IPO; these tokens confer almost no rights. Token holders have approximately 4.5%, Gnosis controls 95.5%. If this was an equity raise it would be a disaster for the Token holders but it’s not an equity raise.

When the auction started I managed to copy and paste the contract address and the JSON interface into the Ethereum Wallet. I did not bid because I did not want to pay $30 a token. So my anecdotal evidence is that the auction played out according to script. Maybe Gnosis should have set the starting price very, very high thus delaying the start of the auction until the point where investors/donators were prepared to bid. It occurs to me that a group of people could pool their Ether and send in a Bid in one transaction, thus ensuring that they got Tokens and if large enough they could act as a whale. I have no evidence this happened, but a lot of Tokens where taken up very fast right at the start of the auction. Much as most of us like to think other people have lots of money, I am sceptical that one single(sane) person would drop a few million dollars on a Token, even if they were very rich. So my take away is this: The price that the auction starts at, should be very high, creating a delay and giving interested bidders enough time to copy and paste addresses etc. etc. I am not sure about pooling, but I suppose all ICOs suffer from this issue.

It makes sense that, as this is a usage Token, the more widespread the distribution of the Token, the better it is for the platform. Issuing 4.5% of the tokens does not seem widespread to me, but then I suppose Gnosis has another 95.5% to distribute. <a href="https://poloniex.com/">poloniex</a> announced that they will be offering trading on GNO in a week, <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/register/ZgfHjW">BITMEX</a> has said they will be offering futures sometime today. And of course <a href="https://www.kraken.com/"> Kraken</a> and <a href="https://www.shapeshift.io/">ShapeShift</a>. It’s going to be fun to watch the price action.

The pressure is now on Gnosis… What will they do: They raised $12.5m but now will they deliver the platform? Will they squander the money and deliver a flawed project? Or, will they just run off with the money?

Time will tell.
