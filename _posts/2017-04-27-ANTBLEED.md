ANTBLEED

Never a dull day in cryptoland. Woke up to <a href="http://www.antbleed.com/">ANTBLEED</a>. In short it seems Bitmain has the ability to remotely shut down miner equipment manufactured by them. This time it’s not a question of how the ASIC is made, it’s in the firmware. That is, it’s a software issue. This is important because it’s easy to look through code or to decompile it and see what’s there, not so easy to reverse engineer an ASIC.

This is akin to standing in a full stadium of 100 000 people and giving them the finger, the problem comes: when they all return the favour.

Time to give Bitmain the finger, BITCOIN is too important a project. If a hard fork is necessary, so be it, because the way mining is currently run, is clearly a security hole. Minds superior to mine need to come up with a new Proof of Work Algorithm and the Bitcoin Network needs to hard fork.

I have not reviewed the code referenced on the ANTBLEED website. I do not have any Bitmain S9 miners to test it on. So this may all be fake news. In which case I apologize for spreading false accusations.

In any event it illustrates that mining in BITCOIN is broken. Whats the trade here I don’t know? Bitfinex trades BCU (Bitcoin unlimited if theres a HF) they are up on the idea that a hard fork is more likely.
