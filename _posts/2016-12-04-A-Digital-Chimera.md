A Digital Chimera

The latest 30% plunge in the Ether price, seems to be related to the most recent unplanned fork. The reason appears to be that basically the Geth and Parity clients went out of sync.

It seems the whole concept of running the Ethereum ecosystem using many different software languages is controversial. In principle it should be fine, but in principle we are all dead, given the age of the universe our measly 70-year lives are effectively a rounding error… in principle at least!

Why is this important? It’s important because the ICOs I like most are ERC20 standard, meaning they raise Ether. If Ethereum fails, they fail. Plus, I am an Ethereum bag holder. So let’s try and think this through simply: Different clients should get exactly the same result; that is, the state of the Ethereum network should be the same no matter what client we use. Of course this is a non-synchrous network so you can’t expect consistency. But you should expect that for some time interval that is longer than the average block time, the two clients agree on the state.

Of course computers and computer languages are presently at a point in time when this cannot be strongly guaranteed. So, the detractors who say “you see many different clients, will lead to forks” have a point. But imagine that you have only one client say a C++ client. Then how do you know if it has a bug? You don't! You blindly accept that: “because you have one chain it must be right”. And woe betide anyone who tries to calculate the state in another way. Of course this is impossible to enforce; there is nothing stopping anyone from replicating Ethereum in another language. If they discover the fault, will they be able to exploit it. I don't know, but it seems reckless to me to just assume that a single client is better. Multiple clients may make Ethereum more fragile in the short term, but I a convinced that in the long term it will make Ethereum more robust.

Its pretty simple to run two clients and if the two get out of sync by a certain number of blocks, to raise an alarm. I used to mine Ethereum solo, I was always checking my Geth client to see if it was at the head of the chain as reported by etherstats or another site. I know many just went to a pool from the outset, but solo was far more profitable to start.

Ethereum is still a very green technology. In my view it was very positive that the response to the fork was fast and decisive: only 10 hrs till the Geth client was fixed. The error and which client was correct was immediately found and reported. Ethereum is slowly but surely creating an unassailible lead over any other block chain. In the end it will be to hard to try and catch up.

So now on to ICOs: I believe that part of the carnage in Ether is due to ICOs dumping the Ether they raised, as the price fell, because at the end of the day their costs are in Dollars not Ether. As the Ether price falls, they have effectively raised less than they thought, so they are forced to sell to try and lock in the cash value in Fiat. This is a classic negative convexity play. Negative convexity for the ICOs, but positive convexity for buyers of Ether!

My model is giving a ratio of Ether to Bitcoin of 56% to 44% so basically its shifted from Ether into Bitcoin. It does that when an asset falls sharply while the other rises. For comparison it was initially 60% to 40% in favour of Ether. Interestingly in practice, it is selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum. This is because as the Ether price falls and the Bitcoin price rises, Bitcoin makes up a higher percentage of the portfolio! So, to rebalance to the 56% to 44% ratio you end up selling Bitcoin and buying Ether.

I will add Zcash soon. This is easier said than done because of the crazy trading in Zcash at the start. But, initially, it won’t be more than a few percent of the portfolio.

Presently I hold no positions in any ICOs.
