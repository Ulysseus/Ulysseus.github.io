# Capital controls and Bitcoin.

This week we woke to news that [South Korea](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/10/south-korea-official-reportedly-readying-bill-to-ban-all-cryptocurrency-trading.html) was going to ban Bitcoin and Ethereum. We have had similar scares out of China and India. The three countries are as different as you can get, yet they all share one thing “Capital Controls”.

Most of my readers in the US or Europe or Canada or Australia are probably thinking what? So here’s the issue, in much of the world, often called the emerging markets, governments have strict capital controls. What this means is that you can’t just move your money from local currency into a foreign currency or to an offshore bank. Generally these rules are there to protect the local economy from a “run” on the local currency. Of course it’s just another mecanism for corruption, government cronies always have access to foreign denominated cash, for the non-connected locals on the other hand, it’s a different matter.

I was born and grew up in apartheid South Africa. Because of the government’s odious policies the country was subjected to sanctions, in 1986 with the enactment of the [Anti Apartheid Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Anti-Apartheid_Act), the country in effect defaulted on its debt. Although South Africa’s economy grew strongly during the first 20yrs of apartheid, economic sanctions and the untenable social situation eventually started to bite. To prevent capital from fleeing the country, the government instituted strong Foreign Exchange Control regulations. The rules were draconian and simple. The whole system was and is still run by the banks who ultimately report to the Reserve Bank. [Supposedly nothing](http://www.money-transfers.co.za/south-africa-exchange-control.php) gets in or out without scrutiny. Of course it was and is subject to corruption. Consider that a violation of the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations in South Africa carries a criminal penalty even 24 years after the end of apartheid. Tax evasion on the other hand may carry fiscal penalties but almost certainly would not result in a criminal conviction.

Back in my younger days of I worked for three of SA’s biggest banks. We would trade forwards on the Rand; that is a contract for the sale or purchase of Rands at a specified date in the future. These are simple contracts which derive their price from the relative differential between the interest rates in Rands and the foreign currency, normally the US dollar, and the Spot exchange rate, which is to say the rate of exchange for delivery in T+2 days. The rate at which the Rand forwards would trade, was never the implied rate: it always differed and sometimes by a significant extent. We referred to this deviation as the country risk premium, and the deviation was always in favour of the dollar. That is to say Forward Rand price was always discounted to its fair value, and you had to pay a premium to acquire dollars. What the risk premium was or should be was anybody’s guess.

I learnt my first lesson in trading from a bellicose Chief Dealer, “I trade the number on the screen, I could give a damn what your model says the price is, I trade the number on the screen”, he blasted at me as he jabbed his finger into the desk to drive his point home. He was reffering to the forward rates quoted between the banks via their Reuters terminals. The lesson was a good one: Who cares what you think or your fancy model says, the only thing that matters is the price you can trade at; are you are prepared to back your bid or offer with real money, the rest is opinion. [We lived in some fear of the Reserve Bank](https://www.resbank.co.za/RegulationAndSupervision/FinancialSurveillanceAndExchangeControl/Pages/Financial%20Surveillance%20and%20Exchange%20Control-Home.aspx) raiding us to check that we were complying with the Foreign Exchange Control Regulations. In reality our Treasury management where very close to the Foreign Exchange officials at the Reserve Bank: I am not suggesting that they bribed them, but when the Reserve Bank needed to “intervene” in the market they would enlist the aid of the banks. Of course we made a tidy profit off such activities; we were careful to not break the rules, but we would have prior warning if we were about to be audited, so we would bend the rules, but always within reason.

Now consider Bitcoin: It knows no borders. It can be instantaneously sent anywhere in the world. Its [krytonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptonite) to Capital Controls.

Hence its popularity in China and in India and in South Korea; also in South Africa.

In most emerging markets, one thing is a near certainty, your local currency depreciates over time, and holding foreign exchange is a hedge against this. An alternative is to hold gold; I won’t get into all the hype and FUD surrounding gold, other than to say a very valuable aspect of gold is its [chemical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold), it’s basically inert, a lump of gold can sit for 1000 years and still be a lump of gold, unlike silver which will oxidise over time. It’s rare, it’s even rare in the entire universe, unlike say diamonds. So you can buy and keep a piece of gold almost indefinitely. What are the problems with gold?

* Storage: How do you stop people stealing it?
* How do you know it’s gold and not an alloy or gold plated tungsten?
* Transportation: It’s heavy and dense.
* Fungibility: How do you spend a little in the case of an emergency? Small denomination coins tend to trade at a “jewelry” to the gold price.

Of course there are ways of dealing with all of these difficulties.

Consider Bitcoin

* Storage: Get a hardware wallet.
* It’s not duplicatable, that’s the whole point of PoW.
* Transportation: Let’s be honest, come on!!
* It’s divisible into units of 100 million.

What’s the downside, will 1 BTC be worth anything in 1000 years, who knows? But I suppose most people could care less about 1000 years from now.

If you take the BTC price in dollars and convert it into a Rand price and then compare this price to the price of a Bitcoin in South Africa in Rands you discover that it can be trading at a premium of up to 25% in South Africa. (So back to my lesson you trade the number on the screen!) Why does BTC trade at such a huge premium? Because it’s a hedge that ordinary people can access, and also because it easily evades Capital Controls. It doesn’t involve opening foreign bank accounts, or storing large amounts of gold or storing large amounts of foreign cash where the risk of forgeries is large. An issue with storing actual cash is demonetization. In 2016 [India unilaterally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Indian_banknote_demonetisation), out of the blue, just declared certain bank notes would no longer be legal tender. If a person owns Bitcoin they can plausibly claim they spent it, lost the private keys, or they could successfully argue that no money actually ever left South Africa, so they are not in contravention of Foreign Exchange Regulations. These advantages are not lost on the average person so there is an almost insatiable bid under Bitcoin and Ether. I should mention that [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) is lead by a South African Riccardo “fluffypony” Spagni.

The situation is the same in South Korea. In [1997 Asia suffered a serious financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis). BTC trades at a premium of up to 20% in South Korea because the country has strict capital controls.

China also has capital controls, as does India. The take away is that if a country has capital controls and the local currency depreciates over time or has suffered crisis in the past where it has devalued severely, then it is rational for locals to hedge themselves against the same eventuality. The demand for cryptocurrencies will create a premium in those currencies. One warning: [It can happen in rich countries too, the UK had capital controls in the 1970s and even had an IMF bailout.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_IMF_Crisis)

Government officials will say it’s people trying to evade taxes. Consider that they are paying a 25% tax/premium to buy Bitcoin, just so they can evade what, a 20% tax? No it’s not tax evasion, it’s also not drug dealers who are not up to paying 25% to buy Bitcoin funded exclusively via bank deposits. If they have found a way to deposit their cash into the banking system, the last thing they need to do is buy Bitcoin at 25% premium to “launder” it, it’s already laundered. Drug dealers need to either charge in Bitcoin or buy Bitcoin with cash, I doubt very much that they can move significant amounts of cash into Bitcoin, without paying a hefty premium.

So now back to South Korea: On Wednesday, the Ministry of Justice’s head; [a man named Park Sang-ki was quoted in the MSM saying that South Korea was planning to impose a ban on cryptocurrency trading.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/10/south-korea-official-reportedly-readying-bill-to-ban-all-cryptocurrency-trading.html) The reaction of the market was understandbly swift and viscous: BTC and Ether got clobbered. Since then the President of South Korea is quoted by yohap news:

[“Justice Minister Park Sang-ki’s remarks regarding the shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges is one of the measures that have been prepared by the Justice Ministry, but it is not a finalized decision and will be finalized through discussion and a coordination process with each government ministry.”](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/search1/2603000000.html?cid=AEN20180111006353315)

So it looks like a typical heavy handed attempt at regulation by a government official without the imagination to see the future.

The Big Mac index is the price of a big mac quoted in local currency and then coverted via the exchange rate to dollars. The idea is that a Big Mac is the same all over the world so should be priced pretty much the same after conversion to a common currency like the dollar. Of course it’s not quite true, but a nice idea.

Bitcoin on the other hand is exactly the same thing, it should trade at exactly the same price everywhere. If it doesn't, it represents frictions; if the mispricing is not arbitraged away it means the frictions are severe or permanent or the pricing indictes signs of distress. Instead of thinking of BTC as volatile, we need to denominate everything else in terms of bitcoin. So it’s not Bitcoin that is volatile it is the dollar or the Korean won that is volatile. Unfortunately it is still too early to make this change. But in the long run it is inevitable. The first globally transferable currency, that has a fixed issued amount, with a preditable inflation policy is a sensible choice to measure the relative value of assets. Note that I deliberately avoid calling Bitcoin an asset. Initially as the new currency gains ground it will be volatile, especially as Fiat currencies particularly from countries with capital controls leak into it, the frictions of money flowing into it will cause prices to be different in different places, eventually these differences will disappear.

Now can the governments of these societies stop Bitcoin? Of course they can, they can just ban it. They can ban the trading of it. They can ban the use of it. Will it stop Bitcoin? Of course not!

What we are witnessing is the early days of a fundamental shift in human affairs; suddenly billions of people who had no access to hard money, will gain access. This is true globalization not the kind we have had until now, which has been globalization for the rich and educated privileged few in the first world.

I expect major societal changes over the next 30 years. The effect of 2 billion people from the “Third World” suddenly finding their place in the world is going to be electrifying and terrifying all at once, prepare for a wild ride.

**Never a dull day in Cryptoland.**
