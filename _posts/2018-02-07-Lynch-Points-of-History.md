# Linch points of history.

Relief rally is it over? Well as of this Morning BTC $8088 Ether $820 still massively below their all time highs. Is it over, who knows? What have we learned?

Yesterday this happened: [THE COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS will meet in OPEN SESSION to conduct a hearing entitled, Virtual Currencies: The Oversight Role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The witnesses will be: The Honorable Jay Clayton, Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; and The Honorable J. Christopher Giancarlo, Chairman, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.](https://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/2/virtual-currencies-the-oversight-role-of-the-u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission-and-the-u-s-commodity-futures-trading-commission)

In an article I wrote last year on the 23 May 2017 called Double, Double toil and trouble.

“ I wrote Trading in cryptos is like no trading I have ever known. Forget about rules, manipulation is rife. Is it profitable? Who knows. Get used to it, it’s going to get way worse, crypto trading is the ultimate anarchic capitalism. Anything goes. There will be schemes we haven’t even thought of yet.

Governments will try to regulate it. Good luck with that! This is trading on a person to person basis, it’s going to get rough out there, be careful!”

Since then we have seen every scam from wash trading to who knows what, then this guy from the CFTC Christopher Giancarlo comes on, from his prepared testimony, I knew something was up, instead of the typical paternalistic crypto currencies are bad you will all be poor, its only for drug dealers terrorists and criminals. We got a balanced reasoned response, and most importantly he understood that; regulation is there to serve the interests of the people, not for people to serve the interests of the regulators! The relief was palpable, I was cheering this guy on!

And then the most amazing thing happened SpaceX did a test launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket sending a Red Tesla Roadster with “Starman” in the driver seat with a “Don’t Panic” button on the control display shooting into orbit at 20 000 km/hr. Watching the twin boosters return to earth was an amazing moment. When the rocket was being fired, everyone was chanting the count down 10 9 8 7 … 1. I turned to my 15 year old son and remarked remember this, when one day you are sitting in a rocket going to space and all the passengers are chanting the countdown.

As a parent as a older human you cannot believe the emotional impact this launch and the CFTC chairman talking about the younger generation trying to create a new world has had on me. To have the two together, too experience history, and to know that its a historic moment is a rare rare thing. This is the second time it has happend to me. The first was the fall of the Berlin wall.

Truly this is a priviliged time to be alive!
